I'm a motivated Sixth Form student with a strong interest in IT, particularly in support, networking, and cybersecurity. I'm always eager to learn and grow.


## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Driven by my passion for IT, I have started self-learning topics such as hardware, networking, and cybersecurity. Iâ€™m now looking to secure an apprenticeship where I can gain practical experience, develop my skills, and grow within a real-world IT environment.
